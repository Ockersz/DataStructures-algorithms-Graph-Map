# DataStructures-algorithms-Graph-Map

This software is designed to represent data structures and algorithms using a graph data structure and the Dijkstra algorithm for a map. 
Its main functionality is to allow users to add cities and define the paths to neighboring cities along with their corresponding distances. 
This information is then used to create a graph representing the map.

Once the graph is created, users can select a source and a destination city. 
The program will then use the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between the two cities and display the distance of that path. 
Additionally, to enhance user experience, consider adding features such as the ability to remove cities and paths,
editing existing paths, and visualizing the map. These features would allow users to easily manage and modify the map to better suit their needs.

Also this program uses the Gmap API to represent the Map in realtime.
